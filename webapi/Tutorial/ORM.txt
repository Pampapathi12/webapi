Yes, that's correct! **ORM** (Object-Relational Mapping) is a programming technique that essentially **maps database tables to objects** in your code, allowing developers to interact with a database using **object-oriented programming** principles rather than raw SQL queries.

### How ORM Translates Tables into Objects

1. **Database Table** ↔ **Class**:
   - Each database table corresponds to a class in your code.
   - Example: A `Users` table in the database will be represented as a `User` class in your application.

2. **Table Columns** ↔ **Class Properties**:
   - Each column in the database table corresponds to a property of the class.
   - Example: A `Users` table with columns `Id`, `Name`, and `Email` will map to a `User` class with properties `Id`, `Name`, and `Email`.

3. **Rows in the Table** ↔ **Objects**:
   - Each row in the table corresponds to an object (or instance) of the class.
   - Example: A row in the `Users` table with values `(1, 'John', 'john@example.com')` will map to a `User` object like:
     ```csharp
     var user = new User { Id = 1, Name = "John", Email = "john@example.com" };
     ```

### Benefits of ORM Mapping Tables to Objects

1. **Abstraction**:
   - Developers work with objects and collections instead of writing SQL directly.
   - Example: Using LINQ in .NET:
     ```csharp
     var users = dbContext.Users.Where(u => u.Name == "John").ToList();
     ```
     Instead of:
     ```sql
     SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Name = 'John';
     ```

2. **Productivity**:
   - Faster development since you don't need to write repetitive SQL queries.

3. **Maintainability**:
   - Centralized mapping means that changes to the database schema are easier to manage in code.

4. **Portability**:
   - Allows switching between different databases with minimal code changes since the ORM handles database-specific SQL.

### Example: ORM in Entity Framework

#### **Database Table**
```sql
CREATE TABLE Users (
    Id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    Name NVARCHAR(100),
    Email NVARCHAR(255)
);
```

#### **Mapped Class**
```csharp
public class User
{
    public int Id { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

#### **ApplicationDbContext**
```csharp
public class ApplicationDbContext : DbContext
{
    public DbSet<User> Users { get; set; }
}
```

#### **Interacting with the Database**
Instead of writing raw SQL:
```sql
SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Id = 1;
```

You can do:
```csharp
var user = dbContext.Users.FirstOrDefault(u => u.Id == 1);
```

### **How Does ORM Work Internally?**
1. **Model Definition**:
   - You define your classes and their relationships.
   - Example: Defining a `User` class to represent a `Users` table.

2. **Mapping Configuration**:
   - The ORM maps class names to table names and properties to column names.

3. **Query Translation**:
   - LINQ or other object-oriented queries are translated into SQL by the ORM.

4. **Database Interaction**:
   - The ORM executes the SQL on the database and maps the results back to objects.

### Real-World Analogy for Understanding ORM
Think of ORM as a **translator**:
- The database speaks "SQL" (a relational language), and your application speaks "Objects" (OOP language like C#).
- The ORM translates between these two "languages" seamlessly, so you don't have to do it manually.

This abstraction saves time and reduces errors, especially in large applications.
